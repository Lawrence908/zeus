# docs/swarm-orchestration-plan.md - Swarm Orchestration Plan (Argo)

**Goal:** give the swarm a software project goal + a target repo, and have it **scope** the work, **decompose** it into a task graph, **dispatch** sandboxed Claude Code workers to do the work, **verify** against acceptance criteria, and drive to completion - under **checkpoint approvals**.

Working name: **Argo** (the quest engine); workers are **argonauts**; the scoper is **metis**. Names are tentative - swap to taste (Greek convention per root `CLAUDE.md`).

## Locked decisions (this phase)

| Decision | Choice |
|---|---|
| Target domain | Software / dev tasks (this repo + other local projects) |
| Autonomy (v1) | Checkpoint approvals - plan approval + approval on risky/write actions |
| Worker substrate | Hybrid - Zeus orchestrator + Claude Code / Agent SDK workers |
| Isolation | Container / OS sandbox (OpenShell gateway / NemoClaw), git worktree per task |
| Repo scope | **Any project under `~/`** (dev-scoped: edit code + open PRs; never deploy/restart services) |
| Worker invocation | **Claude Code CLI, headless** (`claude -p …`) in the sandbox container |
| Merge strategy | **PR-per-task** - each passing node → branch → PR for your review/merge |

## What we build on (existing substrate)

- `AgentRuntime` / `AgentDefinition` (`zeus/orchestration/runtime.py`) - YAML agents, lifecycle.
- `TaskRunner` - **sequential** step executor; `StepResult`; `on_failure: skip|retry|abort`. → extend to a DAG.
- Bus (`bus.py`) with Aegis pre/post hooks on every call; in-memory task ring buffer → **replace with durable store**.
- Kairos daemon - observe/decide/act loop (single-purpose today).
- Sandbox: `docs/nemoclaw-ops.md` (OpenShell gateway :8080, NemoClaw containers); Aegis `code_execution.yaml`, `file_access.yaml`, `tool_arguments.yaml`.

## Architecture

```
 goal + repo
     │
     ▼
 [Metis: Scoper/Planner]  → spec + task DAG (nodes: title, deps, acceptance, tool_scope)
     │   ── APPROVAL GATE 1 (approve plan) ──
     ▼
 [Argo Coordinator]  ── schedules ready DAG nodes (deps met), ≤ max_parallel
     │        │
     │        ├─▶ [Argonaut worker]  (Claude Code / SDK subagent)
     │        │      • ephemeral sandbox container + git worktree of target repo
     │        │      • scoped tools: edit / shell / test / git
     │        │      • write/risky action ── APPROVAL GATE 2 (or auto per policy)
     │        │      • every tool call ── Aegis
     │        │
     │        ▼
     │   [Verifier]  runs acceptance checks (tests/lint/build) per node
     │        │  fail → bounded retry / re-plan   pass → merge worktree
     ▼        ▼
 all nodes done + project gate ── APPROVAL GATE 3 (final review/merge) ── DONE
```

**Components (new, under `zeus/orchestration/swarm/`):**
- `planner.py` (Metis) - goal → scoped spec → DAG. Uses oracle context + Library repo knowledge; `small_llm_call` for structure, chat LLM for reasoning.
- `dag.py` - task-graph model + scheduler (ready-set, topological, parallel).
- `coordinator.py` (Argo) - run lifecycle, approval gates, budgets, retries, merge.
- `worker_client.py` - spawns/monitors an argonaut (Claude Code headless / Agent SDK) inside a sandbox container; streams StepResults over the bus.
- `verifier.py` - acceptance-check runner (per-node + project-level).
- `approvals.py` - approval-gate primitive + `PENDING_APPROVAL` state.
- `store.py` - durable run/task/approval store (SQLite first; Postgres if it graduates).

## Data model (durable - replaces the ring buffer)

- **Run** `{ id, goal, repo, spec, status, budget, created_at }`
- **TaskNode** `{ id, run_id, title, deps[], acceptance, tool_scope, status, worker_id, results[], attempts }`
- **Approval** `{ id, run_id, task_id, kind: plan|write|final, state: pending|approved|rejected }`
- Extend `TaskRecord`/`StepResult`; add DAG edges. Statuses gain `pending_approval`, `blocked`.

## API + UI surface

- `zeus/core/` → `/swarm/*`: `POST /swarm/runs` (submit), `GET /swarm/runs/{id}` (+ DAG), `POST /swarm/runs/{id}/approve`, `GET /swarm/runs/{id}/stream` (SSE/WS), `POST /swarm/runs/{id}/kill`.
- Zeus OS → new **Swarm** app: submit goal, live DAG view, approve gates, per-node logs.
- Approvals also reachable via Telegram (reuse `integrations/telegram`).

## Safety contract (extends the Agentic Safety Contract)

- **Every** argonaut tool call passes Aegis (`code_execution`, `file_access`, `tool_arguments`).
- **All writes are sandboxed**: worktrees + ephemeral containers; nothing touches homelab services / `compose.yaml` / running containers - this phase is **dev-scoped only** (ops automation is a separate, deferred scope with its own gate).
- **Per-run budgets**: USD (reuse the small-LLM ledger pattern), wall-clock, tool-call count, `max_parallel` workers. Exceed → pause for approval.
- **Kill-switch** + full audit trail in the run store; default-deny tool scope per node (planner grants the minimum).

## Phasing

- **Phase 0 - Foundations.** DAG task model + durable run store; `/swarm/*` API skeleton; approval-gate primitive; dispatch to a **stub** worker (no sandbox yet). Verifies the state machine + gates end-to-end.
- **Phase 1 - One sandboxed worker.** A single Claude Code argonaut in a NemoClaw/OpenShell container on a git worktree completes **one** scoped task with an acceptance check, Gate 2, and Aegis. Proves the worker + sandbox + merge path.
- **Phase 2 - Scoper + sequential DAG.** Metis turns a goal into spec + DAG; Gate 1; coordinator runs the DAG respecting deps (still 1 worker).
- **Phase 3 - Parallel + verify loop.** N parallel argonauts; verifier-driven iterate-to-done; budgets + kill-switch.
- **Phase 4 - UX + resilience.** Zeus OS Swarm app, Telegram approvals, metrics, durable resume after restart.

## Resolved

- **Repo scope:** any project under `~/`. Still **dev-scoped** - argonauts edit source in worktrees and open PRs; they never run deploy/restart/`docker` against live services. Editing an infra file (e.g. `services/*/compose.yaml`) in a worktree → PR is allowed; a human merges + deploys.
- **Worker invocation:** Claude Code CLI, headless (`claude -p` with a scoped allowed-tools set + per-task system prompt), one process per node inside its sandbox container. See `docs/claude-code-architecture-notes.md`.
- **Merge strategy:** PR-per-task. Each node that passes acceptance → its worktree branch is pushed → a PR is opened (linked in the run store / Swarm UI). Gate 3 becomes "review the open PRs."

## Proposed defaults (adjust anytime)

- **Cost ceiling:** hard cap **$10 / run** (surfaced from the small-LLM + Claude Code usage ledger); pause for approval at 80%.
- **max_parallel:** **3** argonauts (bounded by host + sandbox capacity).
- **Worker image:** one base sandbox image (git, ripgrep, node, python, common build tools) + a per-run overlay hook for project-specific toolchains. Refine at Phase 1.
- **Retry budget:** 2 acceptance-fail retries per node before it escalates to an approval gate.

## Roadmap linkage

Fits root `CLAUDE.md`'s orchestration principles (tool-first, plan/execute/reflect, Aegis on every autonomous path) and extends Projects 7/10 in `docs/ZEUS_LINEAR_TICKET_PLAN.md`. Add a new project block there once Phase 0 scope is agreed.
